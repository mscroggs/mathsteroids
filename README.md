# Mathsteroids
Mathsteroids is a game based on asteroids that can be played on a selection of interesting mathematical surfaces.
Press `A` and `D` to steer the ship left and right, `W` to move forwards and `K` to fire. Destroy the asteroids to win points.

You can play mathsteroids at [mscroggs.co.uk/mathsteroids](http://www.mscroggs.co.uk/mathsteroids).
